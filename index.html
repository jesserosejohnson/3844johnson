                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Prior to taking this Writing and Digital Media class, I had a little, very basic, knowledge of HTML and CSS and no practical digital writing experience. Through participating in this class, I hoped to continue expanding my abilities, in regard to both my writing and my use of digital media, so I could gain a more well-rounded skill set.</p>
                    <p>Now that I have completed (or almost completed) this class, I feel that I have a much better grasp on the basics of some of the essential skills I will need to successfully complete my degree and find a job after graduation.</p>
                    <h2>Goals</h2>
                    <p>I am wrapping up my sophomore year at Virginia Tech with the intent of graduating in the spring of 2019. Last semester, I decided to major in Professional and Technical Writing, and last week I added Literature and Language as my second major. I hope to use the skills I learn during my years here as a technical writer after graduation, so the material I am learning in this class and the other tech writing classes I will take in the coming semesters is highly relevant to my future.</p>
                    <p>While I preferred the classes focused on “traditional” liberal arts subjects when I first arrived at Virginia Tech and still very much enjoy them, I recognize that aspiring to Virginia Tech’s ideal of the VT-shaped person will broaden both my skill set and my world view and help me to discover new interests that I was not previously aware of. The classes I have taken since arriving at Virginia Tech fall primarily into the “vertical” and “horizontal” categories of the VT-shaped model; through taking them, I have improved not only my writing, but my ability to research and analyze. While the “enhanced T” and “V” are  important aspects of both my majors and graduating as a well-rounded person, I have not yet had the opportunity to apply either to my studies in any significant way. I intend to change that in the coming semesters.</p>
