                    <h1>Invent the Future</h1>
                    <p>When I first read this assignment, I was stumped. Aside from piggybacking off of the plot of either the group podcast or group video, I couldn't think of anything even remotely interesting that fit the project's criteria. Then, last week, I decided to stop procrastinating and add a second major, Literature and Language. This gave me the inspiration I needed to find a new angle to address: how the VT-shaped student model applies to those with two majors.</p>
                    <p>While my majors both fall within the English department and therefore overlap in several areas, many others have majors that barely overlap at all—Creative Writing and Biology, for example. At first, I thought this might make it more challenging to apply the VT-shaped student framework, but after some consideration, I changed my mind. While it might be a slightly lengthier process, some aspects of the VT-shaped model even seem to encourage multiple areas of study. After all, students with multiple areas of focus might already be fulfilling horizontal aspects of one major through classes that are required for their other major.</p>
                    <p>I decided the best approach to this topic would be through the “creation” of an app I very creatively named the “VT-Shaped App.” It would, in essence, serve as both a check sheet and a guide, suggesting classes and notifying students of local internships and other opportunities. The check sheet aspect would contain an online, interactive version of the check sheets students currently receive in paper form, updating automatically when major requirements or class names change and fulfilling the “vertical” section of the VT-shaped model. The guide section would address the other three areas of the VT-shaped student. For the “horizontal” section, the app would take into account previous classes taken by the student before suggesting future classes that would fit remaining CLE or elective requirements. In a way, the app itself could serve as part of the “enhanced T” format by allowing students to control more aspects of the app; it would also include options for required “digital literacy” classes for students of all majors. Finally, the “V” area would vary significantly depending on the student’s major. For a Professional and Technical Writing and Literature and Language major such as myself, it might suggest internships or volunteer opportunities involving tech writing or editing, while a Math or History major would receive entirely different options geared towards their major and future career.</p>
