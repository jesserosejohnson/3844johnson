                    <p>I found the material covered in Module 1 to have a steep learning curve, but once I grasped the basic concepts, it wasn’t as foreign as I expected. In a way, it almost seemed similar to learning a new language. In both instances, it isn’t necessarily the “vocabulary” that proves difficult, but learning an entirely new structure. One thing that particularly stood out to me about composing in HTML, as someone who had never done it before, was how standard, and even repetitive, the formatting was once we learned the very basics. I think it’s very interesting how the most basic webpages and the most complicated ones share the same basic HTML “skeleton.”</p>
                    <p>The topic covered in Module 1 that I found most compelling was expressed most clearly by Lawrence Lessig in “Creators.” I found the points he was making, accurately summed up by his closing remarks, “Free cultures are cultures that leave a great deal open for others to build upon; unfree, or permission, cultures leave much less. Ours was a free culture. It is becoming much less so,” to be particularly poignant and thought-provoking. Perhaps I also found it particularly relatable because of the use of Disney as an example, but as I looked more closely at the history of early digital writing through the other assigned readings, I noticed how relevant and necessary free cultures are to digital writing in a way that I had overlooked prior to this class.</p>
                    <p>The use of the article and section elements were easily the most challenging aspects of composing in HTML, and ones I’m still not certain I completely understand. I found the slight overlap in their usage to be somewhat confusing, especially when they were first introduced. As the narrator in the Lynda.com videos mentioned, they still seem very similar to me. I came away with the impression that they are, at least at some level, interchangeable and which one you use in a particular situation is primarily a matter of personal judgment and opinion.</p>
                    <p>Based on the material we have covered in Module 1, I now view the concept of “digital writing” much more broadly than I previously did. While I was aware that digital writing, along with computers and the internet itself, was a relatively new area, the reading assignments for this module reminded me of exactly how recent these developments really are in the grand scheme of things. Despite it’s relative “youth” compared to other writing forms, it spans a variety of genres and audiences. I started the first unit of this class almost unconsciously picturing “digital writing” as long, drearily boring papers filled with scientific and technological jargon to understanding it to be a much more diverse kind of writing. With that understanding, I realized it was not as different from the kind of writing I have done in other English classes as I had first imagined it to be.</p>
                    <p>I believe, overall, that I have learned much more in just Module 1 than I expected to come away with, especially as someone who can, occasionally, be slightly “computer illiterate.” I also found that I enjoyed the material, especially the actual process of composing in HTML, much more than I thought I would.</p>
