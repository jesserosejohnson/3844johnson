                    <p>"Disney (or Disney, Inc.) ripped creativity from the culture around him, mixed that creativity with his own extraordinary talent, and then burned that mix into the soul of his culture. Rip, mix, and burn. This is a kind of creativity. It is a creativity that we should remember and celebrate."</p>
                    <p>"VT-shaped learning is an expansion of the notion of the T-shaped student, which traditionally describes depth and breadth. With VT-shaped students, disciplinary depth and interdisciplinary capacities are enhanced by intentional learning opportunities, which prepare students to solve complex global problems while remaining adaptable, resilient, and culturally competent. Elements of the university’s motto — <i>Ut Prosim</i> (That I May Serve) — are also incorporated, in the land-grant tradition of serving society."</p>
                    <p>"Recently, leaders in higher education, industry, government, foundations, and professional associations have encouraged the development of T-shaped students and professionals. A T-shaped individual has deep knowledge of a discipline and/or way of thinking, often seen in higher education as a student's major. This is complemented by breadth in a variety of disciplines and ways of thinking coupled with crosscutting skills such as communication, project management, and critical thinking. Virginia Tech looks to expand this model, creating "VT-shaped students." The "V" enriches the model bringing in technological literacy, informal communal learning, and guided experiential learning."</p>
                    <p>"Destination areas are voluntary educational paths in which students can take core classes but also pursue cross-disciplinary opportunities, meaning they can concentrate on a unique field while also working toward a more traditional degree, such as engineering or English. Future faculty hiring and university infrastructure and building investments will be tied to destination areas. Lab space and classrooms will be linked with new learning communities. For example, the university pledged a $225 million investment in a business and analytics complex that will feature office space and dorms for living-learning communities."</p>
                    <p>"These innovators, who may be dreamers today, but who hope to become very active organizers tomorrow, project a unified, if not a centralized, world organ to ‘pull the mind of the world together,’ which will be not so much a rival to the universities, as a supplementary and co-ordinating addition to their educational activities—on a planetary scale."</p>
                    <p>"To create these kinds of learners, it may be useful to remember that, alongside invention, we need to find both inspiration and imagination. The greatest of land-grant institutions continue to integrate practical and liberal education, and they do so because technology never works without people as part of the equation, because innovation is fundamentally a human pursuit."</p>
                    <p>"Much of the academic research is into the human interface side of browsing through a complex information space. Problems addressed are those of making navigation easy, and avoiding a feeling of being 'lost in hyperspace.'"</p>
                    <p>"Steve Jobs, who credited a class in calligraphy and typefaces for part of the human appeal of his computers, insisted that ‘technology alone is not enough—it’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our heart sing.'"</p>
                    <p>"Situated in a problem context, disciplinary boundaries stretch and overlap to meet the demands of the given domain. This intersection of disciplinary excellence is where strengths are formed that address problems related to improving the human condition. These strengths are so compelling that Virginia Tech is a primary destination for students and faculty wishing to pursue work in these areas."</p>
                    <p>"Continuously advancing information and communication technologies will enable connections that will obviate the need for place-bound learning or research. In future decades, virtual faculty, student, mentor, or work relationships will be as rich and effective as current face-to-face interpersonal experiences. Within digitally enabled human-centered smart environments we will experiment, prove ideas, and learn from failures."</p>
                    <p>"Presumably man's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems. He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory. His excursions may be more enjoyable if he can reacquire the privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if they prove important."</p>
                    <p>"Liberal and practical education are not so much two different things as they are two distinct but interrelated parts of the same thing. In its traditional sense, the term ‘liberal’ in ‘liberal arts’ ought not be understood to have any particular political valence, beyond its commitment to transformation—education is neither Republican nor Democratic. It does, however, have a civic valence, the civitas that implies obligation to the community, to the welfare and well-being of a community. Liberal education involves being able to balance a free range of inquiry alongside the needs and obligations of the community. It is this interplay between inquiry and service that defines Virginia Tech’s <i>Ut Prosim</i> (That I May Serve) model"</p>
                    <p>"The intersection between the arts and sciences, between liberal and practical education, should not just be a moment in the past, particularly not at a land-grant institution like Virginia Tech."</p>
